# Hey, I'm in
"Hey, I'm in" is a tool to organize and manage recurring events.

## Guidelines
* Issues are tracked within GitHub
* A commit message should include a reference to an issue (e.g. `My test (#ISSUE)` or `My text, closes #ISSUE`)
* Everything, except localized strings, is written in english
* Documentation in code or in the [wiki](https://github.com/PascalHonegger/HeyImIn/wiki)
* Development is done on a feature branch or directly on the master branch
* Every commit is tested using GitHub Actions
* The `master` branch is used for development deployments and should be mostly stable
* The `stable` branch is used for production deployment and should only contain stable versions

## Changelog
A detailed changelog can be found under the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/PascalHonegger/HeyImIn/releases) page.
